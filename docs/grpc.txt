The following is the gRPC LocationMessage format:

message LocationMessage {
    string person_id = 1;
    float latitude = 2;
    float longitude = 3;
}

I've also set up a gRPC client file for testing the gRPC server. It sends two sample location messages. Here is how to use it:

1. Run "kubectl get po" and note down the location-producer-grpc pod name.
2. Run "kubectl exec --stdin --tty <pod-name-from-step-1> -- /bin/bash"
3. Run "python app/grpc-location-client.py"
4. You will see Finished message which means it was good with sending the messages.
